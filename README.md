## Twitch Clip Downloader

# Overview
Webscraping tool that gets the url for the top 20 Twitch clips on a webpage. In the later portion of the program these clips are automatically downloaded to the local computer.

Many Youtubers make full-time income by stitching together the top clips from Twitch and then uploading it to their channel. This tool automates the most time-intensive portion of their work (finding and downloading clips), allowing for videos to be made more quickly.

# Examples of the types of links that can be passed into this program:

1.) The "video" or "clips" page of a specific user. Search parameters can be modified to your liking, "filter=" and "range=" in this case. **https://www.twitch.tv/devinnash/clips?filter=clips&range=7d**


2.) The "video" or "clips" page of a specific directory/game. Like above, search parameters can be modified. **https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Super%20Smash%20Bros.%20Melee/clips?range=7d**
